# Custom Hash Function in C++

This project implements a custom hash function in C++ for efficient data indexing and retrieval. The function is designed to generate unique hash values for given inputs, minimizing collisions and ensuring fast performance. It can be applied to hash tables, key-value storage systems, or as part of a custom data structure.

### Features:
- Lightweight and efficient hashing
- Optimized to reduce collisions  
- Suitable for strings, integers, or custom objects
